<p align="center"> In here you will find a basic node api that serves as an IoT server experiment. It conects to an mqtt server with tls encryption and send triggers based on the selected device.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project was created to a project factory class @ IADE Europeia in Lisbon
It aims to shed some light in IoT apliances comunications.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
node
```
```
mosquitto server 
```


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

1- Start by cloning this repo
<p>
2- Create a postgres db
<p>
3- Run npm install to install all project dependencies
<p>
4- This project uses sequelize, so besides runing a postgres db, there are some npx comands the we have to do first.
<p>
After running npm install and creating a postgres db run:

```
npx sequelize-cli db:create
```
```
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```
```
npx sequelize-cli db:seeds
```
This comenads will create the database, migrate the model into postgres and seed some examples into the database.

After this steps you are ready to go! 

TODO 
```
ADD DOCKER OPTIONS
```


Run 
```
npm start 
```
To start the server and you can test some calls to this API.

Start by: 
```
get http://localhost:3000/api/users/1
```
This call will return user wityh id = 1 and all associated devices:
```json
{
    "user": {
        "id": 1,
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "email": "kobe@blackmamba.com",
        "password": null,
        "createdAt": "2022-05-08T03:36:40.574Z",
        "updatedAt": "2022-05-08T03:36:40.574Z",
        "Devices": [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "name": "Device 1",
                "userId": 1,
                "status": "inactive",
                "createdAt": "2022-05-08T03:36:40.592Z",
                "updatedAt": "2022-05-08T16:25:48.822Z"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

OR: 
```
post http://localhost:3000/api/switch_state
```
with the json payload of:
```json
{"user_id":1,
"device_id":1
}
```
This call will change to ```n=!n``` state of the device
